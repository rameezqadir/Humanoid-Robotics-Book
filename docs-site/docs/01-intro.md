# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics  
## An AI-Native Textbook on Embodied Intelligence

This book explores **Physical AI** — artificial intelligence systems that operate in the real world and obey physical laws.

Unlike purely digital AI, **embodied intelligence** connects perception, reasoning, and action through a physical body.

## Course Goal
Bridge the gap between the **digital brain** (AI models) and the **physical body** (humanoid robots).

Students learn to:
- Design humanoid robot systems
- Simulate physical environments
- Apply AI models to real robotic control
- Build autonomous humanoid agents

## Toolchain
- **ROS 2** — robotic nervous system
- **Gazebo & Unity** — digital twins
- **NVIDIA Isaac** — perception & navigation
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** — cognition
